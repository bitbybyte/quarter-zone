Our current priorities are as follows, descending from highest priority:

- Ingest singleplayer leaderboards from Steam, Epic Games, Xbox Live, PSN, Ninendo Online, and Oculus, investigated in this order
- Ability to track and chart multiplayer SR changes over time for a user
- Ability to view display name changes for a user; at the moment, we display the most current scraped
- Expose other multiplayer stats, including play time and Connected areas cleared
- Linking multiplayer and singleplayer records to a unified user ID
- User profiles aggregating all records and modes
- Exportable data either through an API or CSVs

For all other feature requests, please submit an issue with a brief description. Please avoid creating duplicate issues and instead react on issues that match your request.
