Our current priorities are as follows, descending from highest priority:

- Finalize events data for Elo tracking
- Interactive utilities that allow users to directly compare user performance
- Ability to view display name changes for a user; at the moment, we display the most current scraped
- User search by display name and platform
- Exportable data either through an API or CSVs

For all other feature requests, please submit an issue with a brief description. Please avoid creating duplicate issues and instead react on issues that match your request.
