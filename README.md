Our current priorities are as follows, descending from highest priority:

- Ingest singleplayer leaderboards from Epic Games, Xbox Live, PSN, Ninendo Online, and Oculus, investigated in this order
- Ability to view display name changes for a user; at the moment, we display the most current scraped
- Exportable data either through an API or CSVs
- General rewrite to make ingestion and processing faster, more reliable

For all other feature requests, please submit an issue with a brief description. Please avoid creating duplicate issues and instead react on issues that match your request.
